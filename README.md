# AlgoLab-ETH-Zurich
Algorithms Lab is a hands-on, intensive, essential course in Computer Science, held at ETH Zurich.

It is focused on the development of algorithmic and problem solving skills.

This repository has a double aim:
* Help students who are currently attending the course find and understand solutions to the given problems;
* Provide a wide collection of problems as a training resource for anyone interested in algorithms.

## Contents
* Dynamic programming
* Sliding Window
* 2D Geometry & Exact Computation Paradigm (CGAL: 2D Kernels)
* Shortest Paths (BGL: Dijkstra), Minimum Spanning Trees (BGL: Kruskal), Maximum Matchings (BGL: Edmonds)
* Greedy
* Split & List
* Linear Programming (CGAL)
* Proximity Structures (CGAL: Delaunay Triangulations)
* Max Flow & Min Cuts
* Min-cost Max Flow

## Organization 
Each week from 1 to 9 contains problems on a specific subject, starting from very basic ones to more structured ones. These are useful to learn an algorithmic technique with an increasing degree of difficulty.

Weeks 10 to 13 contain exam-like problems, covering multiple topics faced during the course, therefore requiring the combination of multiple techniques in order to be solved. These are useful to self-assess one's skills after learning all the topics.

Problems of the Week are problems you should solve after completing the corresponding week. You can take them as challenges to be completed in 2 hours each.

The 3-fold problem sets are a collection of problems very similar to one another, yet requiring different techniques to be solved. The aim of these sets is not to write code, rather analyze the problems and identify the correct techniques to solve them.

## Test sets
Testsets are provided for all the <i>Weekly Exercises</i> and all <i>Problems of the Week</i>.

## Reminder: don't panic
AlgoLab is one of the hardest courses in Computer Science at ETH. Therefore it is normal to spend very long time writing code, debugging and understanding the techniques being taught. If you have been stuck for several hours on some problem, remember almost every other student has been stuck for several hours on some other one (or very likely the same!)
